## 🌟 Overview

**Free Online File Tools** is a modern, client-side web application designed to solve everyday document and media management tasks without compromising privacy or performance.

Unlike traditional online conversion utilities that transmit sensitive files across the internet to third-party cloud servers, **every single transformation in this suite executes 100% in your local web browser session**.

### 🔒 Why Local-First Matters
* **Absolute Privacy**: Financial statements, legal contracts, medical scans, and personal photos never leave your device.
* **Instantaneous Processing**: No uploading delays or waiting in server conversion queues.
* **Offline & Private**: Powered by modern web standards, HTML5 Canvas, Web Workers, and WebAssembly.
* **No File Size Compromises**: Supports high-resolution images up to 50 MB and extensive PDF documents up to 100 MB.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security Principles

1. **Zero Data Transmission**: No documents, images, or extracted text are uploaded to any external server.
2. **Client-Side Verification**: Files are validated on device using file signatures (magic bytes) to prevent malformed or malicious uploads.
3. **Automatic Memory Cleanup**: Temporary blob URLs and allocated ArrayBuffers are revoked and discarded immediately after processing or file reset.
4. **No Tracking or Tracking Pixels**: Completely private with no invasive document logging.
